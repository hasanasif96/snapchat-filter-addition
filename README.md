# snapchat-filter-addition

Inspired from Snapchat, completed project of adding different filter like fake sunglasses and nose on detected face. Learned alot about images and ROI. Implemented in OpenCV and Dlib to detect mainly faces positions and inside the faces, eyes and mouth position. It uses then this information to add different accessories to the faces (nose, Sunglasses, etc).
